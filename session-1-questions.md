1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?
I have used GitHub to get codes in the past but I have never used it as my own depository. I would like to use it effectively so that I can use it in my teaching :)

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?
To share codes with and among students.

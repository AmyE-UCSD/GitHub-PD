1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?
I have used GitHub to get codes in the past but I have never used it as my own depository. I would like to use it effectively so that I can use it in my teaching :)

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?
To share codes with and among students.

3. What are ways that GitHub might help you and your students manage code?
It gives both students and me to have easy access to the shared codes.
